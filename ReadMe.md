## The Idea
Bored on a Friday night I decided to see whether I could just create some simple API endpoints with Python and the help of ChatGPT. Why?
1. I am not a developer so though I can understand and write some code in Python there would be no way I would be able to code it from scratch 
2. I needed to make my £20 worth of ChatGPT subscription

So can a DevOps engineer with some coding experience create an API in Python?
